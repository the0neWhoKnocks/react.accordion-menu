## Example

- [x] Lazy-load DOM content
- [x] Lazy-load network data
- [ ] Has ability to set `opened` on all instances
- [ ] Shows different label types: string, component, large font, multiline
- [ ] Customized styling
- [x] Nested menus
- [x] Icons: plus/minus (default), chevron (chevronIcon), none (noIcon)
- [ ] `disabled`: Don't add toggle listeners, gray out icon, remove pointer style.
- [ ] Have accordion items work on their own, but orchestratable by an
      accordion component that can limit how many items are open at a time.

## Research

- [ ] Publish module with pre-compiled CSS to get rid of module dependency
      on Emotion. Look into https://github.com/4Catalyzer/astroturf
- [ ] gZip size badge for README https://shields.io/category/size
- [x] Adding `react` and `react-dom` as externals to keep npm module size down.
- [ ] Using CodeMirror for code examples
